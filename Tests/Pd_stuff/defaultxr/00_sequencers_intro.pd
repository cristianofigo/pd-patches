#X text 61 8 defaultxr's sequencer abstractions;
#X text 55 42 these are all slightly more complex sequencers. [tracker]
is basically a list of messages that can be edited using keyboard shortcuts
(open it to read more). [drumseq] is a multi-pattern drum sequencer.
there are 4 rows of 16 toggle boxes \, each box representing a step
\, and each row representing an outlet. [anaseq] is an "analog sequencer".
it too has multiple patterns and outlets. each step in the [anaseq]
can be enabled or disabled as well using the row of toggles at the
bottom.;
#X text 428 83 [bpmm] is a beats-per-minute abstraction. the left outlet
sends bangs on the downbeat \, as well as diagnostic messages (open
the abstraction for information). the second outlet outputs a bang
on each 16th note \, and the third outlet outputs floats ranging from
0 to 15 for each 16th note. you'll probably want to connect the third
outlet to these sequencers to keep them in sync. the fourth outlet
is a signal outlet that outputs in the range of 0 to 1 in sync with
the bpm.;
#X text 342 481 the best thing you can do is open each sequencer abstraction
and read the comments inside them! they're all fairly complex but relatively
simple to use once you understand them.;
