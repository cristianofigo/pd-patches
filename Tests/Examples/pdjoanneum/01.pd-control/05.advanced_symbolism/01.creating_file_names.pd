#X text 17 24 COMMON USES;
#X text 47 47 I believe that this object was developed first to allow
PD to generate sequential file names - perhaps to be used in conjunction
with [soundfiler] or [openpanel]. For example \, an audio loop recorder
might generate a continuous series of sound files to be saved on a
hard drive...like below:;
#X obj 54 136 bng 15 250 50 0 empty empty Bang_me 18 7 0 8 -262144
-1 -1;
#X obj 54 160 f;
#X symbolatom 54 215 0 0 0 0 - - -;
#X text 53 238 This file name could be used when saving the audio data
to disk.;
#X obj 87 161 + 1;
#X obj 54 187 makefilename file-%d.aif;
#X text 20 280 LIMITATIONS;
#X text 45 304 This object does not provide advanced formatting and
parsing abilities. For example \, you cannot use spaces or odd characters
in the argument - also the argument can only include ONE variable.
Although \, these limitations can be easily overcome with a little
ingenuity and compromise -- see below.;

#X text 107 198 This object generates symbols according to a format
string (the argument) \, for use as a series of filenames \, table
names \, or whatnot. You can plug in a variable number or symbol by
putting "%d" or "%s" in the string. If you put "%s" in the string \,
be sure to send it a symbol and vice versa... there' no checking. Each
[makefilename] object can have only one variable.;
#X text 108 53 Integer - If a number is sent to the inlet \, the argument
should be written with a "%d" which represents the location of the
incoming variable number in the outgoing symbol. Floats will be converted
to integers.;
#X text 107 126 Symbol - If a symbol is sent to the inlet \, the argument
should be written with a "%s" which represent the location of the incoming
variable symbol in the outgoing symbol. Lists will be truncated.;

#X text 25 40 The PDDP was proposed initially in early 2002 by Krzysztof
Czaja who suggested that Pure Data was in need of comprehensive documentation.

#X text 25 89 The project is now managed un-officially by Dave Sabine
who acts as primary author and editor. The people involved in this
project include (alphabetically):;
#X text 25 184 PDDP will eventually be available in the main PD distribution
\, but for now is available at Dave's web site: http://www.davesabine.com/media/puredata.asp
;
#X text 25 231 All comments \, corrections \, etc. regarding the PDDP
reference files should be directed to Dave Sabine: dave@davesabine.com
;
#X text 14 282 THINGS TO NOTE:;
#X text 25 308 Authors: If you would like to participate in this project
\, simply gather together information about objects \, tutorials \,
examples \, etc. and contact Dave Sabine for info about formatting
your documents. All documents should then be forwarded to Dave to be
included in the PDDP download which is available at his web site.;
#X text 25 396 Externals and other Libraries: Each PDDP document includes
mention of "related objects from other PD libraries" as well as mention
of "related native PD objects". The objects from other libraries are
available only if you download those libraries from their respective
authors and integrate them properly into your version of PD. We do
not and cannot maintain a complete list of externals - but we try.
For more info about externals and other objects \, see http://www.pure-data.org/
and the Pure Data Base at http://iem.kug.ac.at/pdb/;
