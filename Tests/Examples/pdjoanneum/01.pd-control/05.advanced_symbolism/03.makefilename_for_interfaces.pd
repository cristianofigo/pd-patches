#X text 17 16 Building user interfaces in PD is a difficult balance
between usability and performance. PD is not winning any awards for
usability - let's face it: it's powerful \, it's cool \, and that's
the way we like it. You're not here because you want a colourful \,
bevelled interface...you want the raw power that object oriented languages
provide mixed with a few of the conveniences that a graphic environment
affords.;

#X text 18 156 However \, there are times when sacrifices must be made
in the area of performance to provide users with on-screen reporting
\, record keeping \, and sometimes even a few 'pleasantries'. Consider
the following examples - but always weight the pros and cons when incorporating
these types of interfaces. Performance vs. Usability.;

#X text 14 17 PDDP: Pure Data Documentation Project;
#X text 25 40 The PDDP was proposed initially in early 2002 by Krzysztof
Czaja who suggested that Pure Data was in need of comprehensive documentation.

#X text 45 162 - Michal Seta;
#X text 45 135 - Miller Puckette;
#X text 45 148 - Dave Sabine;
#X text 25 89 The project is now managed un-officially by Dave Sabine
who acts as primary author and editor. The people involved in this
project include (alphabetically):;
#X text 25 184 PDDP will eventually be available in the main PD distribution
\, but for now is available at Dave's web site: http://www.davesabine.com/media/puredata.asp
;
#X text 25 231 All comments \, corrections \, etc. regarding the PDDP
reference files should be directed to Dave Sabine: dave@davesabine.com
;
#X text 14 282 THINGS TO NOTE:;
#X text 25 308 Authors: If you would like to participate in this project
\, simply gather together information about objects \, tutorials \,
examples \, etc. and contact Dave Sabine for info about formatting
your documents. All documents should then be forwarded to Dave to be
included in the PDDP download which is available at his web site.;
#X text 25 396 Externals and other Libraries: Each PDDP document includes
mention of "related objects from other PD libraries" as well as mention
of "related native PD objects". The objects from other libraries are
available only if you download those libraries from their respective
authors and integrate them properly into your version of PD. We do
not and cannot maintain a complete list of externals - but we try.
For more info about externals and other objects \, see http://www.pure-data.org/
and the Pure Data Base at http://iem.kug.ac.at/pdb/;
